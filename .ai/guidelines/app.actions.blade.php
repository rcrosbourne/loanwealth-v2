# App/Actions guidelines

- This application uses the Action pattern and prefers for much logic to live in reusable and composable Action classes.
- Actions live in `app/Actions`, they are named based on what they do, with no suffix.
- Actions will be called from many different places: jobs, commands, HTTP requests, API requests, MCP requests, and more.
- Create dedicated Action classes for business logic with a single `handle()` method.
- Inject dependencies via constructor using private properties.
- Create new actions with `php artisan make:action "{name}" --no-interaction`
- Wrap complex operations in `DB::transaction()` within actions when multiple models are involved.
- Some actions won't require dependencies via `__construct` and they can use just the `handle()` method.
